            <h2>What do we offer?</h2>
            <hr/>
            <p>
              We love to build unique products that people want to use.
              <br/>[DO WE ENCOURAGE AD-WORK HERE? Mentioned brands]
            </p>
            <p>
            We normally help our clients in one of the following ways:
            </p>
            <dl>
              <dt>Design and develop new products</dt>
              <dd>This ranges from prototyping an idea to test the market (warblr) to complete build of a proven idea (catinaflat)</dd>

              <dt>Give a spark to an existing product [WHAT WAS THE PHRASE RACH USED?]</dt>
              <dd>Sometimes an existing product or site has fantastic potential but needs a shot in the arm.
              Or perhaps your site is performing well but the time is right to
              make some changes. We worked with our friends at Razorfish to get
              allthingshair.com ready for delivery and nurture it through its
              first year all the while making incremental improvements
              [ONE TECHNICAL, ONE USER BASED] 
              </dd>

              <dt>Post launch [DOES THIS OVERLAP WITH THE PREVIOUS POINT?]</dt>
              <dd>Although sometimes overlooked, what happens *after* a site
              goes live can be just as critical as the initial design and
              build. The web is a living thing and websites often need to
              adapt, often in subtle ways, to keep up. Whether it's tweaking
              server infrastructure to better meet the service's demands or
              just staying on top of security updates we ensure that everything
              we build keeps running smoothly.</dd>

            <p>We've worked with companies ranging in size from two-person startups to multinational, FTSE 100 giants.</p>

              <h3 id="allthingshair">Allthingshair.com</h3>
              <p>Allthingshair.com is a multi-market youtube channel that features styling tips from a variety of celebs and well-known fashion bloggers.</p>
              <p>We teamed up with razorfish.com to help them get
              allthingshair.com ready for launch and since then have helped
              guide it to meet its promise. We've added support for more
              international markets (with new markets begin added all the time)
              which is great for the end user and have both created new tooling
              as well as improving the existing ones for the site's admins.
              Sometimes it seems as if the importance of non public facing
              portions of the site can be underestimated but Razorfish fully
              understand the importance of a great experice from front-to-back.
              We're very proud of everything about this site.</p>

              <h3 id="catinaflat">Catinaflat.com</h3>
              <p>Our friends at catinaflat.com have a long running cat sitting
              business that they have carefully built up over the last few
              years. They approached us to help them create a new version of
              their existing site that would help put cat sitters in touch with
              cats that need sitting.</p>
              <p>What we love about catinaflat.com is the focus on the user.
              They want to ensure that the person you entrust your cat to is a
              reliable person and so they go above and beyond in thoroughly
              interviewing and performing a background check on any potential
              cat sitters.</p>

              <p>Making video games has to be the glamour job of the software
              industry and while we can't lay claim to having built any of the
              gameplay mechanics we are very proud to have been involved in the
              making of Seabeard.</p>
              <p>We've known the guys from Handcircus.com for a while now
              and so when they asked if we would be available to build the online
              backend for Seabeard we jumped at the chance. This was quite a
              task as it involves massively multiplayer gameplay and required
              highly performant services that worked well across mobile devices
              with all of the vagaries of mobile networks. Check out Seabeard
              now on the appstore.</p>

              <p>Over at AMV BBDO they are very keen to develop the digital
              industry's next generation of talent and part of that is their
              graduate scheme. We built the graduate.amvbbdo.com site to
              facilitate the application process for graduates as well as the
              reporting tools to smooth the process for those on the other side
              of the curtain who review the applications.

            <p>We worked with the incredibly clever team at Warblr to put
            togther the first version of their app. Warblr is an audio
            recognition app for birdsong; you simply record the calls of one
            our feathery friends on your mobile device and Warble can identify
            the species of bird as well as provide information about that
            species.</p>
