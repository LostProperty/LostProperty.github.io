            <hr/>
            <p>
              We are a team of veteran developers and technologists who build usable software for the web and iOS.
            </p>
            <p>
              We love to build unique products that people want to use.

            <h2>What do we offer?</h2>
            <hr/>
            <p>
            We normally help our clients in one of the following ways:
            </p>
            <dl>
              <dt><h3>Design and develop new products</h3></dt>
              <dd>This ranges from prototyping an idea to test the market (<a href="/#warblr">warblr</a>) to complete build of a proven idea (<a href="/#catinaflat">catinaflat</a>)</dd>

              <dt><h3>Give a spark to an existing product</h3></dt>
              <dd>Sometimes an existing product or site has fantastic potential
              but needs a shot in the arm. Or perhaps your site is performing
              well but the time is right to make some changes. We worked with
              our friends at Razorfish to get <a href="/#allthingshair">allthingshair.com</a> ready for delivery
              and nurture it through its first year all the while making
              incremental improvements that ranged from improved search and internationalisation across multiple global markets
              to developing a complete UX revamp of the admin system. </dd>

              <dt><h3>Post launch</h3></dt>
              <dd>Although sometimes overlooked, what happens after a site
              goes live can be just as critical as the initial design and
              build. The web is a living thing and websites often need to
              adapt, often in subtle ways, to keep up. Whether it's tweaking
              server infrastructure to better meet the service's demands or
              just staying on top of security updates we ensure that everything
              we build keeps running smoothly.</dd>

              is a multi-market youtube channel that features styling tips from
              a variety of celebs and well-known fashion bloggers.
              </p>
              <p>We teamed up with razorfish.com to help them get
              allthingshair.com ready for launch and since then have helped
              guide it to meet its promise. We've added support for more
              international markets (with new markets begin added all the time)
              which is great for the end user and have both created new tooling
              as well as improving the existing ones for the site's admins.
              Sometimes it seems as if the importance of non public facing
              portions of the site can be underestimated but Razorfish fully
              understand the importance of a great experice from front-to-back.
              We're very proud of everything about this site.</p>

              Our friends at <a href="https://catinaflat.com">catinaflat.com</a>
              have a long running cat sitting business that they have carefully
              built up over the last few years. They approached us to help them
              create a new version of their existing site that would help put
              cat sitters in touch with cats that need sitting.</p>
              <p>What we love about catinaflat.com is the focus on the user.
              They want to ensure that the person you entrust your cat to is a
              reliable person and so they go above and beyond in thoroughly
              interviewing and performing a background check on any potential
              cat sitters.</p>

            <p>We worked with the incredibly clever team at <a href="http://warblr.net">Warblr</a> to put

            recognition app for birdsong; you simply record the calls of one
            our feathery friends on your mobile device and Warble can identify
            the species of bird as well as provide information about that

              <p>Making video games has to be the glamour job of the software
              industry and while we can't lay claim to having built any of the
              gameplay mechanics we are very proud to have been involved in the
              making of <a href="http://www.handcircus.com/seabeard/">Seabeard.</a></p>

              <p>We've known the guys from <a href="http://www.handcircus.com">Handcircus.com</a>
              for a while now and so when they asked if we would be available
              to build the online backend for Seabeard we jumped at the chance.
              This was quite a task as it involves massively multiplayer
              gameplay and required highly performant services that worked well
              across mobile devices with all of the vagaries of mobile
              networks. Check out Seabeard now on the Apple appstore.</p>
